## 🧠 Expertise

With a strong academic foundation from **Vellore Institute of Technology**, where I graduated with distinction in Computer Science & Engineering (CGPA: 9.19/10), I've built deep expertise in:

- 🔄 **Backend Engineering & Microservices**  
  Proficient in building distributed backend systems using `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `Flask`, and `Node.js`, with extensive experience in microservice orchestration using `Docker` and `Kubernetes`.

- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps**  
  Skilled in deploying scalable solutions using both `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)` and `AWS`, including services like `GKE`, `Cloud Functions`, `Lambda`, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

- 📊 **Observability & Performance Engineering**  
  Deeply familiar with system monitoring, logging, and tracing tools (`Prometheus`, `ELK Stack`, `Grafana`, `Micrometer`), ensuring high reliability and performance of production systems.

- 🧠 **AI & Machine Learning**  
  Experienced in building intelligent applications using `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `Scikit-learn`, and `LangChain`, with published research in malware analysis using ML/DL models.

- 🔒 **System Design & Architecture**  
  Well-versed in designing stateless/stateful services, RESTful APIs, distributed architecture, and implementing best practices in system scalability, observability, and resiliency.
